This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South \\nAfrica.

During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers.

He expresses gratitude to the people of India and those living abroad for their association and support during his tenure. He then outlines 10 important messages that he wants to share with the nation, which are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerate development, focusing on the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empower villages and mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "3. Develop a strong agricultural sector, from seed to food.\n",
      "4. Defeat problems and succeed by overcoming obstacles.\n",
      "5. Overcome problems through partnership and collaboration.\n",
      "6. Show courage in combating calamities and crises.\n",
      "7. Foster connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "8. Defend the nation and its pride.\n",
      "9. Support a youth movement for a developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl, Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. He assures her that it's a thoughtful question and commits to working towards achieving this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and acknowledged it as thoughtful. They assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work to make it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is emphasizing the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. They recall a visit to a village in Nagaland where they saw a village council functioning with financial powers and taking decisions, resulting in a prosperous village with fruit and vegetable production. However, the speaker notes that there is a need for physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products from villages to the market. They also highlight an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, known as PURA, which provides urban amenities in rural areas by connecting 65 villages with a population of 300,000. This includes provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity. The PURA initiative has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs. The speaker is encouraging the empowerment of all 600,000 villages in India to deal with their development and be well-connected with urban societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of the Periyar PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) initiative in Thanjavur district, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through the support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, and villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, planting, and food processing. The initiative has also enabled the development of internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative ability of the people and enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products. The speaker suggests that similar PURA initiatives are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with a goal of establishing 7000 PURAs nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Meeting over 6000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They believe that farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries can work together to increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum.\n",
      "2. The speaker recounts a meeting with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a man who was born without hands and legs, but had a radiant and happy demeanor. Despite his physical limitations, he had learned to sing and asked the speaker what he could do for him. The speaker was moved by his confidence and resilience, and was inspired to focus on defeating problems and succeeding in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes two incidents that highlight the importance of overcoming challenges and the power of human spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first incident is about a physically challenged person who was encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others to pursue his passion for music. Despite his physical limitations, he was able to develop his talent and eventually performed in front of a large audience. The speaker is inspired by this person's positive attitude and perseverance, and notes that his music is now being used to inspire others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second incident is about the response of the people of Urusa village in Jammu and Kashmir to the devastating earthquake of 2005. Despite the severe damage to their school and homes, the villagers did not give up. They praised the role of the Army, Air Force, and state government in rescue and relief operations, and worked together to rebuild their community. The speaker is impressed by the courage and resilience of the people of Urusa, who have been able to overcome their challenges and rebuild their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a reflection on the author's experiences with courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The author shares two specific instances:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. During a visit to a village affected by an earthquake, the author witnessed the bravery and enthusiasm of children and villagers who participated in relief efforts, even in the face of damage to their homes. The author also notes the presence of the Acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir and state government authorities, who were working together to provide relief grants to affected families.\n",
      "2. The author recalls a visit to Car Nicobar Islands in 2005, where they met with Tribal Council Leaders and children who had been affected by the 2004 Tsunami. Despite significant human losses, the islanders had taken in affected victims as their own and showed remarkable courage and resilience. The author was inspired to compose a poem, \"Sea Waves,\" which was sung by the villagers and reflected their determination to overcome adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author concludes by highlighting the importance of connectivity and societal transformation, referencing a speech they delivered to the Pan African Parliament in 2004. However, the details of this speech are not provided in the given text.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed a Pan African e-Network, a project to connect 53 African countries with a seamless and integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connectivity, estimated to cost $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa. The pilot project in Ethiopia has already been commissioned, with the Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students. Additionally, specialists from CARE Hospital will provide telemedicine services to African countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes the speaker's experiences and achievements in various fields. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The speaker mentions a telemedicine project between Hyderabad and Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa, which has been providing live consultation services to doctors in cardiology and radiology since 2006. The project has enabled instant communication between the two locations through the Pan African network.\n",
      "* The speaker expresses pride in India's achievements in bringing technology to the people, particularly in Africa, which has led to societal transformation on the continent.\n",
      "* The speaker then talks about the Indian Defence Forces, highlighting their bravery and commitment to duty. They mention visiting various military installations, including the Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and Sukhoi-30 fighter jets. The speaker emphasizes the importance of the Defence Forces in guarding the nation and protecting its citizens.\n",
      "* The speaker also mentions interacting with members of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces, who are making significant contributions to ensuring the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "* Finally, the speaker mentions a youth movement called Lead India 2020, which aims to transform young citizens into enlightened individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is talking about the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh to become enlightened citizens. They have seen positive changes in the students, such as increased self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a sense of responsibility towards the nation. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student who helped her father quit smoking after attending a Lead India training camp. The speaker believes that empowering India's 540 million youth through value-based education and leadership is key to the country's success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization, while also focusing on economic growth and development. The speaker believes that India has made significant progress in the past 60 years and is confident that it can become a developed nation by 2020. To achieve this, the country needs to empower its people, particularly the youth, and work towards a shared vision of a developed India. The speaker outlines five key goals for this vision, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reducing the rural-urban divide\n",
      "* Ensuring equitable access to energy and water\n",
      "* Integrating agriculture, industry, and services sectors\n",
      "* Providing quality education to all, regardless of socioeconomic background\n",
      "* Becoming a destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with a quote from a famous poem, emphasizing the importance of aiming high and striving for one's goals. The overall message is one of optimism and hope for India's future, with a call to action for citizens to work together to achieve the country's mission of becoming a developed nation by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a perfect nation, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Healthcare is accessible to everyone\n",
      "* Governance is transparent, responsive, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated\n",
      "* Everyone feels included and valued\n",
      "* The nation is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with a sustainable growth path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, President of India, expresses gratitude to the citizens for their support over the past five years. He shares his mission to unite the diverse hearts and minds of the Indian people, instilling confidence that \"we can do it\". He commits to working towards making India a developed nation by 2020 and concludes by wishing the citizens God's blessings.\n",
